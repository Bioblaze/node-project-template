# Force batch scripts to always use CRLF line endings so that if a repo is accessed
# in Windows via a file share from Linux, the scripts will work.

# For the following file types, normalize line endings to LF on
# checkin and prevent conversion to CRLF when they are checked out
# (this is required in order to prevent newline related issues like,
# for example, after the build script is run)
