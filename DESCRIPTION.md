# Node Project Template

The focus for this Project was to make something simple to just pull or use as a template for standard Node.js Projects, it includes support for standard deployment to a Server. Also includes Docker Support as well, as Base Structure for General Node.js Applications.

This Project is going to be extended apon to make a simple and effective way for people to develop in Node.js without spending hours of time setting up their project base before they even begin to do the structure of their Project itself.
